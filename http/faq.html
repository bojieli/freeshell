<h1>Freeshell FAQ</h1>

<h2>General Info</h2>

<h3 id="00">00. Who can register freeshell?</h3>
<p>USTC staff and students with @ustc.edu.cn or @mail.ustc.edu.cn email address.

<h3 id="01">01. I Want more freeshells.</h3>
<p><a href="logout.php">Logout</a> and register a new one :)
<p>Each email address can register at most 10 freeshells.

<h3 id="02">02. Can I continue to use freeshell after graduation?</h3>
<p>Yes, if we are not running out of disk space.
<p>Please back up your data periodically to your own device in case of hardware or software failure.

<h3 id="03">03. How much CPU / memory / disk space do I have?</h3>
<p>Disk space is initially limited to 5G. But if you need larger space, please contact us.
<p>CPU and memory is not limited and fairly shared among freeshells. That means that if no other freeshell on the physical node is busy, you can take over virtually all CPU and memory resource of the hardware.
<p>Hardware spec (may subject to change): CPU 8 cores, Memory 16G.

<h3 id="04">04. Can I crawl a website using freeshell?</h3>
<p>It is okay, but do not push the website too hard.
<p>If we receive complainments or disputes from any organization or individual, it is our sole discretion to limit or block Internet access of your freeshell without prior notification.

<h3 id="05">05. Are miners / World Community Grid / SETI@home allowed?</h3>
<p>No. Miners for digital currencies and World Community Grid projects are in blacklist. Once detected, the suspicious process will be terminated immediately.
<p>Our computation resource is not idle enough to contribute to projects like SETI@home. Thanks for your understanding.


<h2>Privacy</h2>

<h3 id="10">10. Is network traffic monitored?</h3>
<p>We monitor and record the amount (but not the content) of inbound and outbound traffic on per-freeshell basis.
<p>We monitor, record and <a href="http://status.lug.ustc.edu.cn">publish</a> the amount (but not the content) of inbound and outbound traffic on per-hardware-node basis.
<p>For HTTP / HTTPS proxy, we monitor and record client IP, HTTP request line (including URL), request size, response code, response size, response time and some other satistical data. We do not monitor HTTP request or response body.

<h3 id="11">11. How is outbound traffic routed?</h3>
<p>We use policy routing to route outbound traffic to China Telecom, China Mobile and CERNET. For some IP ranges that appear to be blocked, we use VPS. That's why some sites complain about exceptional login IPs.
<p>The routing policy table is constantly changing. See <a href="https://gitlab.lug.ustc.edu.cn/boj/smartproxy">Source Code and Config Files</a> of SmartProxy.

<h3 id="12">12. Is file content on disk monitored?</h3>
<p>We monitor (but not record) the executive of all running processes through /proc interface to discover potentially harmful processes. Other files are not touched.

<h3 id="13">13. Is my data backuped?</h3>
<p>A daily snapshot of file system is saved. It occurs at 03:20 every morning.
<p>Because syncing the file system requires many disk reads, system load could be high in the morning. If you encounter any problem due to high disk utilization, please feel free to contact us.

<h3 id="14">14. Where do my software come from?</h3>
<p>New freeshells are based on OpenVZ official Debian 7.0 template (<a href="http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/openvz/template/precreated/contrib/debian-7.0-amd64-minimal.tar.gz">Download</a>). Freeshells created before October 2013 are based on OpenVZ Official Debian 6.0 template (<a href="http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/openvz/template/precreated/contrib/debian-6.0-amd64-minimal.tar.gz">Download</a>).
<p>The default Debian package source is <a href="http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/">USTC Open Source Software Mirror</a>, the official Debian mirror in mainland China. Debian packages ship with digital signatures and checksums, so any mirror (including ours) is cryptographically impossible to alternate package content.


<h2>Account</h2>

<h3 id="20">20. I registered multiple freeshells with different passwords. Which one will I login to?</h3>
<p>If the password matches only one freeshell, that's it.
<p>If the password matches multiple freeshells, a "Select Freeshell" page will show up and you are free to choose one.
<p>If you have multiple freeshells, a link to switch shells will show up on Web Control Panel.

<h3 id="21">21. What is my initial SSH password?</h3>
<p>The same as the Web Control Password at registeration.

<h3 id="22">22. I changed password, but cannot SSH using the new password.</h3>
<p>Note that Web password and SSH password are separate.
<p>To change SSH password, use "passwd" command. If you forget it, click "Reset Root Password" on Web Control Panel.
<p>To change Web password, click "Change Web Password" on Web Control Panel. If you forget it, contact support@freeshell.ustc.edu.cn

<h3 id="23">23. I forgot my root password.</h3>
<p>Login to Web Control Panel and click "Reset Root Password".
<p>We never store passwords in plain text, so no one can regain your original password if you forget it.

<h3 id="24">24. I received a mail asking me for password.</h3>
<p>Freeshell admin team will never ask users for password. Please report the incident to support@freeshell.ustc.edu.cn

<h3 id="25">25. My Web account seems to be stolen.</h3>
<p>Contact support@freeshell.ustc.edu.cn
<p>As a special reminder, keep an eye on weak passwords. Do not use dictionary words, birthday or any password that may have leaked elsewhere.

<h3 id="26">26. Can I create SSH accounts for others?</h3>
<p>Please think twice before doing that. You are responsible for all activities, content and traffic on freeshell.

<h3 id="27">27. Can I create users other than root?</h3>
<p>Sure! The Linux box is dedicated for you.
<p>To add a user with root privilege:
<ol>
<li>adduser [username]
<li>apt-get install sudo
<li>usermod -aG sudo,adm [username]
</ol>

<h3 id="28">28. Can I use SSH key to login?</h3>
<p>Sure! "ssh-copy-id" is your friend.


<h2>Networking</h2>

<h3 id="30">30. Why SSH says "No route to host"?</h3>
<p>Hostname of your freeshell resolves to IPv6 address only.
<p>If you do not have IPv6 access, try IPv4 port mapping on Web Control Panel. The IPv4 address is shared and only the listed ports are mapped to your port.

<h3 id="31">31. I added a network device / IP address but not working.</h3>
<p>This is by design. Network configurations can only be altered in Web Control Panel.</p>

<h3 id="33">32. How can I change my hostname?</h3>
<p>Login to Web Control Panel, click "Change" beside your hostname. You may need to relogin for changes to take effect.
<p>If you change hostname via "hostname" command, it will revert to the old one on reboot, and the DNS Name will not be changed.

<h3 id="34">33. I have changed my hostname, but still cannot use the new DNS Name.</h3>
<p>The hostname in your freeshell should be changed immediately, but due to DNS caching and negative caching, it may take 10 minutes or longer for DNS updates to propagate. If your new DNS name still cannot be used after one hour, please contact us.

<h3 id="35">34. How can freeshells talk to each other?</h3>
<p>Just ping6 your peer's hostname. We have set DNS search domain to "6.freeshell.ustc.edu.cn" and "ustc.edu.cn".
<p>If you have to use IPv4 for inter-freeshell communication, please use $hostname.4.freeshell.ustc.edu.cn which resolves to an internal IP 10.10.x.x.

<h3 id="36">35. Why my IP address appears outside China?</h3>
<p>See <a href="#11">FAQ #11</a>

<h3 id="36">36. How to share files with another machine?</h3>
<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.samba.org/" target="_blank">Samba</a>. It is fully user-space, able to work in freeshell and can be connected from both Linux and Windows.
<p>Since freeshells share a common kernel, kernel-mode NFS will not work.


<h2>Running Network Services</h2>

<h3 id="40">40. Can I create a VPN on freeshell?</h3>
<p>You can use PPTP/L2TP VPN, given that PPP device is available since 02/24/2014. <a href="https://servers.blog.ustc.edu.cn/index.php/2014/02/freeshell-supports-ppp/">More info</a>
<p>VPN solutions relying on TUN/TAP device, such as OpenVPN, are not supported.

<h3 id="41">41. Can I have a dedicated IPv4 address?</h3>
<p>No. We do not have such a large IPv4 address space.
<p>Please use HTTP Proxy if you require IPv4 web access.

<h3 id="42">42. I have set up HTTP proxy, but it seems not working.</h3>
<p>To use HTTP proxy, a Web Server listening IPv4 port 80 should be installed.

<h3 id="43">43. I want HTTPS secure access to my freeshell.</h3>
<p>Sure! Setup HTTP Proxy in Control Panel and visit <strong>https://&lt;yourname&gt;.freeshell.ustc.edu.cn</strong>
<p>If you `want to redirect http to https: In the web server of your freeshell, please check "X-Scheme" HTTP header for "http" or "https".

<h3 id="44">44. How to see the client's real IP behind HTTP proxy?</h3>
<p>See "X-Real-IP" HTTP header. You should use this header field to identify clients.

<h3 id="45">45. How to set up a FTP server?</h3>
<p>vsftpd / proftpd or other FTP server will work. Please use IPv6 (<strong>&lt;hostname&gt;.6.freeshell.ustc.edu.cn</strong>) to connect to your FTP server. IPv4 does not work, because FTP ports are not mapped for IPv4 shared address.
<p>FTP protocol is in plaintext and your password may be easily eavesdropped. It is recommended to use SFTP (secure FTP) instead. SFTP is supported by ssh daemon, so there is no need to install "SFTP server". Most FTP clients also support SFTP, just connect to sftp://&lt;hostname&gt;.6.freeshell.ustc.edu.cn and use your SSH username and password to login.

<h3 id="47">47. How to use my own domain name for HTTP proxy?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add a DNS "CNAME" record to <strong>proxy.freeshell.ustc.edu.cn</strong> at your domain registrar. (DO NOT USE "A" RECORD) It may take some time for DNS changes to take effect.</li>
<li>Fill your own domain in "HTTP Proxy" in Control Panel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Access is HTTP only. HTTPS access to your own domain name will get a SSL certificate error.

<h3 id="48">48. How to use my own domain name to SSH into freeshell?</h3>
<p>Add a DNS "CNAME" record to <strong>&lt;hostname&gt;.6.freeshell.ustc.edu.cn</strong>. Since the IPv6 address is dedicated, you do not need to do anything in control panel.


<h2>Freeshell Management</h2>

<h3 id="50">50. What is the difference between "reboot" and "force reboot", "stop" and "force stop"?</h3>
<p>"Stop" is like executing "init 0" in your freeshell and all processes shut down gracefully. "Force stop" is like pulling the power out of your freeshell and implemented with SIGKILL.
<p>"Reboot" is like executing "init 6" in your freeshell. "Force reboot" is essentially a "Force stop" followed by a "Start" operation.
<p>Please note that "Force stop" and "Force reboot" may not work if "Stop" or "Reboot" is in process and some process in your freeshell refuses to exit. You have to wait the pending stop or reboot to timeout in order to perform force-actions.

<h3 id="51">51. How does "Rescue" feature work?</h3>
<p>"Rescue" is essentially a "Move" operation to the same hardware node. It allocates a new freeshell, copies data and configuration and starts the new freeshell. It takes a long time and the IP address of your freeshell will be changed. If your freeshell is stuck in the kernel and "Reboot" does not help, "Rescue" should be the last resort.

<h3 id="52">52. How does "Copy" feature work?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Setup DNS for new freeshell.
<li>Copy the data in the source freeshell to destination node.
<li>Suspend the source freeshell (if running).
<li>Differentially sync the data from the source freeshell to destination node.
<li>Resume the source freeshell (if running).
<li>Set the hostname, IP addresses and NAT rules for new freeshell (i.e. redo freeshell activation task).
<li>Start the new freeshell.
</ol>

<h3 id="53">53. How does "Move" feature work?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Update proxy config.
<li>Do the same thing as "Copy" feature.
<li>Destroy the source freeshell.
</ol>



<h2>Misc.</h2>

<h3 id="60">60. I'm using Windows, how to connect?</h3>
<p>If you are using Windows, please download PuTTY <a href="http://lug.ustc.edu.cn/~boj/web_dev/ref/putty.zip">Here</a>. The usage of PuTTY can be found on Google.

<h3 id="61">61. I want to change a newer kernel / insert a kernel module.</h3>
<p>Sorry. We use OpenVZ virtualization technology, and all freeshells (OpenVZ Containers) share a same kernel.

<h3 id="62">62. What Linux Distribution am I using?</h3>
<p>If you created freeshell before Nov. 2013, it is a minimal Debian 6.0 "squeeze" system.
<p>Otherwise, you are using Debian 7.0 "wheezy" minimal system.

<h3 id="63">63. Why command X "not found"?</h3>
<p>This Linux box ships with a minimal set of pre-installed software packages. Many utils on normal Linux distributions have to be installed by yourself.
<p>See <a href="http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~yousong/freeshell-basicsetup.html">Basic Setup for Freeshell</a> by yousong.
<p>Please not to install too many packages, since our disk space is limited :)

<h3 id="64">64. "apt-get install" says "404 not found".</h3>
<p>run "apt-get update" to update software index.

<h3 id="65">65. How to install X, GNOME or KDE?</h3>
<p>While it is technically possible, we are strongly against it.
<p>You are expected to learn some shell commands. Break shell, touch Linux!

<h3 id="66">66. Why my program terminated when I exit the shell?</h3>
<p>You should install "screen" and run long-live programs in screen.

<h3 id="67">67. Why udev does not work?</h3>
<p>Due to security concerns, freeshells are not allowed to touch hardware, kernel modules, etc. directly. We have created necessary devices in <strong>/dev</strong> on system startup.
<p>If there is any error while installing or starting udev, it is safe to ignore it.

<h3 id="68">68. I messed up. How can I reinstall the system?</h3>
<p>On Control Panel, there is "Reinstall System" button. There are two options:
<ul>
<li>If you want to keep /home directory, click "keep /home" button;
<li>If you want to delete /home as well, click "NOT keep /home" button.
</ul>
<p>Be sure to backup all your data outside /home, because reinstalling system will erase all data permanently.
<p>If you cannot login via SSH, and you do not have a backup, please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:support@freeshell.ustc.edu.cn">support@freeshell.ustc.edu.cn</a></p>

<h3 id="69">69. Why the numbering of this FAQ looks so strange?</h3>
<p>The first digit is section number, starting from zero and in hexademical.
<p>The second digit is question number in this section, starting from zero and in hexademical.
