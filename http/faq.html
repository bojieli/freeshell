<h1>Freeshell FAQ</h1>

<h2>General Policy</h2>

<h3 id="00">00. Who can register freeshell?</h3>
<p>USTC staff and students with @ustc.edu.cn or @mail.ustc.edu.cn email address.

<h3 id="01">01. I Want more freeshells.</h3>
<p><a href="logout.php">Logout</a> and register a new one :)
<p>Each email address can register at most 10 freeshells.

<h3 id="02">02. Can I continue to use freeshell after graduation?</h3>
<p>Yes, if we are not running out of disk space.
<p>Please back up your data periodically to your own device in case of hardware or software failure.

<h3 id="03">03. How much CPU / memory / disk space do I have?</h3>
<p>Disk space is initially limited to 5G. But if you need larger space, please contact us.
<p>CPU and memory is not limited and fairly shared among freeshells. That means that if no other freeshell on the physical node is busy, you can take over virtually all CPU and memory resource of the hardware.
<p>Hardware spec (may subject to change): CPU 8 cores, Memory 16G.

<h3 id="04">04. Can I crawl a website using freeshell?</h3>
<p>It is okay, but do not push the website too hard.
<p>If we receive complainments or disputes from any organization or individual, it is our sole discretion to limit or block Internet access of your freeshell without prior notification.

<h3 id="05">05. Can I build a public forum?</h3>
<p>No. According to USTC Network Policy, anyone building a public forum should get prior written permission from USTC Networking Center.
<p>It is strongly recommended that you do not provide any UGC (User Generated Content) service on freeshell. You are responsible for any traffic going through HTTP Proxy as well as any content stored on your freeshell.

<h3 id="06">06. Is it okay to put copyrighted material?</h3>
<p>No. Never put any copyrighted, political or illegal content on freeshell. Note that all HTTP requests will be logged.</p>

<h3 id="07">07. Is freeshell "free" for commercial use?</h3>
<p>No. Freeshell is for education and research omly, and we do not have any implied or explicit warranty on Quality of Service, nor are we responsible for any loss caused by service outage, misconfiguration, data corruption, etc.

<h3 id="08">08. I found a vulnerbility of example.com. Can I use freeshell to exploit it?</h3>
<p>Hacker tools are strictly forbidden on freeshell. Once detected, your account may be blocked permanently.

<h3 id="09">09. Is it OK to share USTC resources to Internet?</h3>
<p>Definitely not, if the resource is copyrighted, confidental or sensitive.
<p>Be aware not turn your freeshell into a public proxy due to misconfiguration. Creating public proxies on campus network is prohibited by USTC Networking Policy.


<h2>Account</h2>

<h3 id="10">10. I registered multiple freeshells with different passwords. Which one will I login to?</h3>
<p>If the password matches only one freeshell, that's it.
<p>If the password matches multiple freeshells, a "Select Freeshell" page will show up and you are free to choose one.
<p>If you have multiple freeshells, a link to switch shells will show up on Web Control Panel.

<h3 id="11">11. What is my initial SSH password?</h3>
<p>The same as the Web Control Password at registeration.

<h3 id="12">12. I changed password, but cannot SSH using the new password.</h3>
<p>Note that Web password and SSH password are separate.
<p>To change SSH password, use "passwd" command. If you forget it, click "Reset Root Password" on Web Control Panel.
<p>To change Web password, click "Change Web Password" on Web Control Panel. If you forget it, contact support@freeshell.ustc.edu.cn

<h3 id="13">13. I forgot my root password.</h3>
<p>Login to Web Control Panel and click "Reset Root Password".
<p>We never store passwords in plain text, so no one can regain your original password if you forget it.

<h3 id="14">14. I received a mail asking me for password.</h3>
<p>Freeshell admin team will never ask users for password. Please report the incident to support@freeshell.ustc.edu.cn

<h3 id="15">15. My Web account seems to be stolen.</h3>
<p>Contact support@freeshell.ustc.edu.cn
<p>As a special reminder, keep an eye on weak passwords. Do not use dictionary words, birthday or any password that may have leaked elsewhere.

<h3 id="16">16. Can I create SSH accounts for others?</h3>
<p>Please think twice before doing that. You are responsible for all activities, content and traffic on freeshell.

<h3 id="17">17. Can I create users other than root?</h3>
<p>Sure! The Linux box is dedicated for you.
<p>Although using "root" is OK, for security reasons, we recommend the following:
<ol>
<li>Create your own user (adduser)
<li>Install sudo (apt-get install sudo)
<li>Add the new user to sudo and adm group (usermod -aG)
<li>Try login using new user and password. Try sudo.
<li>Disable root login (sudo passwd -d root)
</ol>

<h3 id="18">18. Can I use SSH key to login?</h3>
<p>Sure! "ssh-copy-id" is your friend.


<h2>Networking</h2>

<h3 id="20">20. Can I create a VPN on freeshell?</h3>
<p>Possibly not. We use OpenVZ virtualization technology, and TUN/TAP device will not work.

<h3 id="21">21. I have set up HTTP proxy, but it seems not working.</h3>
<p>To use HTTP proxy, a Web Server listening IPv4 port 80 should be installed.

<h3 id="22">22. Why SSH says "No route to host"?</h3>
<p>Hostname of your freeshell resolves to IPv6 address only.
<p>If you do not have IPv6 access, try IPv4 port mapping on Web Control Panel. The IPv4 address is shared and only the listed ports are mapped to your port.

<h3 id="23">23. I cannot SSH to IPv4 outside campus.</h3>
<p>This is by design. There are too many attacks on Internet.
<p>If you do have such requirement, please have a look at <a href="http://vpn.lug.ustc.edu.cn">LUG VPN program</a>.

<h3 id="24">24. Can I have a dedicated IPv4 address?</h3>
<p>No. We do not have such a large IPv4 address space.
<p>Please use HTTP Proxy if you require IPv4 web access.

<h3 id="25">25. Can I have an additional IPv4 port mapping to my freeshell?</h3>
<p>No. Your IPv6 address is dedicated. Why not use that?

<h3 id="26">26. I want HTTPS secure access to my freeshell.</h3>
<p>Sure! Use HTTP Proxy and visit https://yourname.freeshell.ustc.edu.cn
<p>If you want to redirect http to https: In the web server of your freeshell, please check "X-Scheme" HTTP header for "http" or "https".

<h3 id="27">27. What is the real IP address behind HTTP proxy?</h3>
<p>See "X-Real-IP" HTTP header. You should use this header field to identify clients.

<h3 id="28">28. I added a network device / IP address but not working.</h3>
<p>This is by design.</p>

<h3 id="29">29. How can I change my hostname?</h3>
<p>Login to Web Control Panel, click "Change" beside your hostname. You may need to relogin for changes to take effect.
<p>If you change hostname via "hostname" command, it will revert to the old one on reboot, and the DNS Name will not be changed.

<h3 id="2A">2A. I have changed my hostname, but still cannot use the new DNS Name.</h3>
<p>The hostname in your freeshell should be changed immediately, but due to DNS caching and negative caching, it may take 10 minutes or longer for DNS updates to propagate. If your new DNS name still cannot be used after one hour, please contact us.

<h3 id="2B">2B. How can freeshells talk to each other?</h3>
<p>Just ping6 your peer's hostname. We have set DNS search domain to "6.freeshell.ustc.edu.cn" and "ustc.edu.cn".
<p>If you cannot SSH to peer on your freeshell, login to Web Control Panel and reset hostname.
<p>Please use IPv6 for inter-freeshell communication, otherwise you may get confused at DNAT hairpining.


<h2>Misc.</h2>

<h3 id="30">30. I'm using Windows, how to connect?</h3>
<p>If you are using Windows, please download PuTTY <a href="http://lug.ustc.edu.cn/~boj/web_dev/ref/putty.zip">Here</a>. The usage of PuTTY can be found on Google.

<h3 id="31">31. I want to change a newer kernel / insert a kernel module.</h3>
<p>Sorry. We use OpenVZ virtualization technology, and all freeshells (OpenVZ Containers) share a same kernel.

<h3 id="32">32. What Linux Distribution am I using?</h3>
<p>If you created freeshell before Nov. 2013, it is a minimal Debian 6.0 "squeeze" system.
<p>Otherwise, you are using Debian 7.0 "wheezy" minimal system.
<p>If you are an expert, you may change your freeshell to any distribution supporting 2.6.32 kernel.

<h3 id="33">33. Why command X "not found"?</h3>
<p>This Linux box ships with a minimal set of pre-installed software packages. Many utils on normal Linux distributions have to be installed by yourself.
<p>Remember not to install too many packages, since our disk space is limited :)

<h3 id="34">34. How to install X, GNOME or KDE?</h3>
<p>While it is technically possible, we are strongly against it.
<p>You are expected to learn some shell commands. Break shell, touch Linux!

<h3 id="35">35. Why my program terminated when I exit the shell?</h3>
<p>You should install "screen" and run long-live programs in screen.

<h3 id="36">36. I messed up. How can I reinstall the system?</h3>
<p>On Control Panel, there is "Reinstall System" button. There are two options:
<ul>
<li>If you want to keep /home directory, click "keep /home" button;
<li>If you want to delete /home as well, click "NOT keep /home" button.
</ul>
<p>Be sure to backup all your data outside /home, because reinstalling system will erase all data permanently.
<p>If you cannot login via SSH, and you do not have a backup, please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:support@freeshell.ustc.edu.cn">support@freeshell.ustc.edu.cn</a></p>

<h3 id="37">37. Why the numbering of this FAQ looks so strange?</h3>
<p>The first digit is section number, starting from zero and in hexademical.
<p>The second digit is question number in this section, starting from zero and in hexademical.
